<h1>AOA Manimation</h1>

Check out some of the Manimations on Analysis of Algorithm <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmoyuZj83Naj_n6TnB_0O2Q">here</a>.

<h2>Description</h2>

The project mainly focuses on the working of various algorithms from DSA covering the concepts of Searching and Sorting Algorithms, Divide and Conquer, Greedy Approach, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking etc. so that it becomes very efficient to understand the logic behind the concept of these algorithms.

The project is very user-friendly i.e. the files work on dynamic input. However, it takes time to render the animations in the mp4 output file.

<h2>How to use?</h2>

Simply run the file using the command <strong>manim -p {{file-name}}</strong>
